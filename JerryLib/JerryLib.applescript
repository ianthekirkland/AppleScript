(* The bad thing about this handler is that it always asks the user for admin credentials whether or not they are actually needed to answer the question on the given path.
Obviously, you can remove the 'with adminstrator privileges'.  Unfortunately, this will cause the method to return 'false' if an existing path cannot be probed because of bad permissions.  I can't see any way to differentiate between inadequate permissions and nonexisting file because they both set errNumber = 54.
The -e checks for directories or files.  To require that the given path be a directory, use -d.  For file, use -f.  For more variations, see:

(* 
If possible, use one of the equivalent handlers quitAppBundleIdentifierIfRunning() or quitAppIfRunningBundleIdentifier() instead, because this handler hangs for 20 seconds if the given app is not running.

The following one-liners, though commonly used,
	quit application "MyApp" 
	tell application "MyApp" to quit
have a couple of annoying behaviors:
1.  If MyApp is not installed, the stupid thing will churn for about 20 seconds, then put up a dialog "Where is MyApp".  That happens even if enclosed in try/end try.
2.  They return before the app is quit.  (See waitUntilDone, below).
The handler quitAppIfRunning was written to fix these issues. 
howSave should be: 'yes', 'no' or 'ask', withOUT the quotes.
waitUntilDone should be 'true' or 'false', withOUT the quotes.  This sets whether or not this handler should wait until the app quits before returning.
	  (Use 'true' if you want to immediately relaunch the application.  Otherwise, you'll get a "Connection is invalid" because it will connect to a dying app.)
aTimeout is the maximum time in seconds that it will waitUntilDone.  You need this in case the app will not quit, which ^will^ happen if a dirty document is open, howSave is 'ask', and the user clicks "Cancel".  The aTimeout does ^not^ affect how long the user gets to respond to the Save/Don't dialog, which is infinite.
Returns true if the app is not running. 
Example: quitAppIfRunning("Bookdog", ask, true, 4.5)
